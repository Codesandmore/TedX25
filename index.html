  <!-- Curating Curiosity

At TEDxMACE 2024, we proudly present our theme for this year: *"Curating Curiosity."* 
What if the questions we ask are just as important as the answers we seek? Curiosity is the 
silent force behind every breakthrough, every leap into the unknown—it dares us to challenge norms, embrace uncertainty, and reimagine possibilities.  

"Curating Curiosity" is not just about celebrating the sparks of wonder; it’s about 
unraveling the limitless stories they ignite—tales of defiance, discovery, and transformation. 
Join us on an inspiring journey into the minds of those who didn’t just ask why but why not—visionaries who turned curiosity into a catalyst for change. Because sometimes, 
the most extraordinary adventures begin with a single, bold question.

                <p>TEDx events are independently organized gatherings designed to bring people together to share ideas and spark deep discussions. 
                    While TED focuses on a global scale, TEDx creates a space that highlights local perspectives, amplifying voices that drive change within communities. 
                    It has been a catalyst for spreading knowledge across the world, fostering a culture of innovation and dialogue. 
                    Licensed by TED, TEDx offers an engaging experience for speakers and attendees alike, providing a stage where local ideas gain global recognition. 
                    These talks are recorded and later shared for free, making knowledge accessible to all through TEDx platforms.</p>
